# Cplusplus-Program

  The project was creating a program for Airgead Banking that displays balance and interest with and without monthly deposits for however many years the user inputs. First the user inputs the starting amount, then monthly deposit, along with the interest rate and number of years to display the balance over time. I was able to create a fully functioning banking application that produced expected results and I was also able to score exemplary for each category in the rubric. In order to enhance my code and productivity I would put more effort behind creating a pseudocode/flowchart before diving into the code. The most challenging part was trying to include all of the functional requirements. All of the skills I learned throughout this project will be useful and transferrable to future projects. In order to make this program maintanable, readable, and adaptable I tried my best to keep it as simple as possible to minimize any confusion.
